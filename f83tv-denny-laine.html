Paul was mean to Denny? Why they don't play together. there is a barber showing photographs Of every head he's had the pleasure to know And all the people that come and go Stop and say " Y'know. I read that Paul didn't tell anyone that his dad had died, but Denny Laine found out in an interview: gt Paul's Wings sidemen were not told of his bereavement. Even Denny Laine, who had known and liked Jim, only found out by accident later that month during a French television interview with Paul, the American teen-idol David Cassidy and himself. When the interviewer asked Paul about his parents, he simply replied that they were both dead, in a tone that discouraged any further inquiry. I was curious if anyone knew anything about the current relationship between Paul and Denny? Despite their falling out all those years ago, they did have a pretty lengthy history together, and there's no denying Denny played a pivotal role in Wings. Do you think a reunion between the two would ever be in the cards? That's something I'd definitely like to see happen
